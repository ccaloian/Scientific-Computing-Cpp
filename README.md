Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ Solutions
==============================================

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the book:

Joe Pitt-Francis and Johnatan Whiteley, "_Guide to Scientific Computing in C++_". Springer, 2012.

__NOTE__: _The presented solutions come with no correctness guarantees_.

The code is organized per chapters, and the file name convention is `ex<exercise_number>.cpp`, or in some cases `ex<exercise_number>_<exerise_subnumbers>.cpp`. The latter case occurs when the sub-exercises require code change that will affect the previous sub-exercises.
