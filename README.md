Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ Solutions
==============================================

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the book:  
Joe Pitt-Francis and Johnatan Whiteley, "_Guide to Scientific Computing in C++_". Springer, 2012.

The code is organized per chapters, and the file name convention is `ex<exercise_number>.cpp`, or in some cases `ex<exercise_number>_<exerise_subnumbers>.cpp`. The latter case occurs when the sub-exercises require code change that will affect the previous sub-exercises.

__IMPORTANT__:  
* _The presented solutions come with no correctness guarantees_.
* _Exercises are solved with tools presented in the book up their corresponding chapter_.
